- drift.lua is the logic behind detecting different stunts and drifts
- scoring.lua uses drift.lua to create score
- general.lua serves as the averal system hub
  - different extensions are loaded/unloaded depending on the "context" and "challengeMode" variables. Eg, in freeroam, "stuntZones.lua" is unloaded, and in challenges that aren't gymkhanas, "stallingSystem.lua" is unloaded
- stuntZones.lua draw different visual elements of the stuntZones and manages different events related to them
- statistics.lua manages communications with the game-wide statistics system
- display.lua is responsible for sending the information to the UI
- stallingSystem.lua incentivize the player to diversify their drifting technics by lowering the rewards if a certain technic is repeated to many times
- saveLoad.lua takes care of loading a driftData file and sending its components to the corresponding drift systems (only stunt zones for now)
- destination.lua ; loads a race file. Detects when a player goes the wrong way
- bounds.lua loads a site file to use its "bounds" component
- quickMessages.lua takes care of displaying "Nice drift!" kind of messages in freeroam
- scoreboard.lua is to gather stats over a drift challenge to display them in the end screen
- sounds.lua is to create sounds â€¦
- driftSpots.lua manages the activation/deactivation of the drift spots
- cruising.lua enables/disables the drift UI apps when drifting in freeroam
